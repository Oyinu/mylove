        Baby if you're reading this messages I just want you to know how <em><strong>IMPORTANT</strong></em> you are to me🥺
        I really really cherish everything we have❤
        I look back and I'm amazed with how far we've come
        I appreciate everything you do for me ,the love, 
        the support,I do not take anything for granted<br><br>
        Our love has the same exhilarating, thrilling, and unpredictable experience as a roller coaster.
         But even if we experience a difficult time, I am confident that we will survive it because we have each other. 
         You make me stronger every day, allowing me to face all my fears. I feel undefeated when I’m around you like
          I can take on anything and everything!
        
        If you love me as I love you. If you feel the way my heartbeats, then there is no going back. Let’s <em><strong>LOVE</strong></em> each
         other until our very last breath because I love you from sunrise to sunset. You own my heart and I have the
          feeling that being with you has been the best choice I made.<br>
        
        My choice of wanting to be with you always makes me remember how we started talking, and growing together
        When I came to school that we stayed at environmental science, our first time of kissing 🥺,I guess that's 
        the first time I'll be kissing someone without feeling disguist🥲😂
        but you made me love it because you know how to do it as the virgin boy you are🥲😂🤭🤭<br>
        
        At times I wonder,why do I even love this boy ,but I don't even have a reason
        but one reason I can't seem to ignore is the fact that I love my life because I have you in it right now. 
        I love you because you make my life worth living. I might not be as good as your first love,the girl you told me about, 
        I know that I am not a perfect girl, but I will do my best for you🥺<br>
        
        At some point when we've started talking seff I tried to shut my heart from everyone and everything, 
        but i wasn’t able because you exist. You’re such a darling for being here for me when I need you. <br>
        
        We spend much time on phone together but those moments are not sweet compared to that moments you say the words,
        <em><strong> ‘I love you.’</strong></em><br>
        
        Everything I'm Sha saying sha is to tell you <em><strong>HAPPY BIRTHDAY</strong></em>
        I wish you longer life and prosperity
        and I pray that you continue to excel, and you have more of a happy life in Jesus name 🙏🏼🙏🏼
